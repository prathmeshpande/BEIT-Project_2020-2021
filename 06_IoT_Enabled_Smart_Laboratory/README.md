# Brief Description:
- This is our final year project in which we are using a programming tool called Node-RED, which helps us establish a link between our connected devices and our automation system. 
- It also has a built-in dashboard functionality, which is accessible via a browser.
- Instead of building an Android Application, we have decided to use Node-RED as the GUI is accessible via browser on any platforms, which ensures cross-platform compatibility.
- All the appliances among the laboratory are connected to Relays (and MQTT if wireless), which are controlled using Node-RED, hosted on Raspberry-Pi.
- Using Smart NORA we have integrated support for google assistant and google home.
- Using NGROK, we exposed our Raspberry-Pi server securely to the internet for cloud access anywhere in the world
