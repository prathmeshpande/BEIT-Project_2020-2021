#Brief Description:
This is our final year project in which we are using a programming tool called Node-RED, which helps us establish a link between our connected devices and our automation system. 
It also has a built-in dashboard functionality, which is accessible via a browser.
All the appliances among the laboratory are connected to Relays, which are controlled using Node-RED and MQTT broker, hosted on Raspberry-Pi.
Using Smart NORA we ave integrated support for google assistant and google home.
Using NGROK, we exposed our Raspberry-Pi server securely to the internet for cloud access anywhere in the world.
